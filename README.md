This project involves performing comprehensive data analysis on a fictional music store database using SQL. The database comprises several tables containing information on employees, customers, invoices, artists, tracks, and genres. The project is divided into three sets of questions—Easy, Moderate, and Advanced—that explore various aspects of the business, such as identifying top customers, most popular music genres, and cities with the highest revenue. The goal is to extract actionable insights to support business decisions and promotional strategies.
